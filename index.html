                     <p>In 2023, the Milford Hall of Fame recognized the legacy of inductee Sheriff Slavin, the man who inspired Boys Village. For over three decades,
                        from 1934 to 1972, New Haven's J. Edward Slavin was bent on deterring youth from a life of crime. Slavin envisioned a home where troubled boys could live, work, and learn as a way to redirect their energies away from risky behaviors.
                        He drew inspiration from the success of a residential program in Nebraska, founded by Father Edward J. Flanagan in 1917, which would grow into a fully functioning community known as Boys Town.
                        Slavin even published several comic books in 1945 entitled "Courage Comics" featuring Sheriff Jack, who would save young offenders from jail and a life of hard crime. Serving as the first president of Boys Village,
                        his version of Boys Town, Slavin paved the way for what Boys &amp; Girls Village has become today.

               <p>Kimone Facey began working for BGV in August 2023 but this was not her first experience with the organization. As a youth, Kimone was in foster care and participated in Work to Learn before and after BGV began running the program. Her childhood made her curious about social work as a career so she pursued a degree. </p>
               <p>After receiving her degree in social work, Kimone was working as a Hiring Manager at Old Navy. Her foster mom encouraged her to follow her true interests and reach out to BGV for a job. Kimone was nervous to interview, but decided to take a leap of faith and was awarded with a position in BGV'S Work to Learn program.</p>

               <p>As a Job Coach, Kimone's role is to teach the youth life skills such as how to cook, how to clean, and anything else you need to know to successfully live on your own.
                  She tells the story of a kid she works with who struggled with time management. He would often miss his bus home from the program. Kimone worked with him for a long time,
                  teaching him how to keep an eye on the time and make sure he has everything ready to go home even when he's having a good time with the other kids. 
               </p>
              <p>He doesn't miss his bus anymore. These small victories are what make the job so meaningful to Kimone because she knows that's  a skill this youth will take with him through life. </p>
               <p>Kimone's favorite part of her job is connecting with the kids. She knows from her lived experience that legitimizing their feelings makes them feel like real people. Someone recently referred to Kimone as their mom because she makes them feel safe. The youth are excited to tell her about their day and are open to tell her things and discuss whatever is on their mind.
                  "As workers we should meet the kids where they are, "Kimone explains. "We should validate them, welcome them, check in on their day. They are so much more than what it says on their individual sheet. Make them realize they matter."

               <p>In his 25-year career as a Juvenile Probation supervisor for the State of Connecticut, Oliver Macklin played a crucial role in assisting numerous children and families in overcoming obstacles. </p>
               <p>Oliver began working with BGV six and a half years ago as a Juvenile Justice Consultant and played a pivotal role in BGV establishing a relationship with Court Support Services. His past connections with the Executive team of the court system helped ease this process.</p>

               <p>Over the past year, Oliver has been promoted to Vice President of Residencies. Before that, his role consisted of providing consultancy across the campus, to coach staff on building stronger connections with BGV clients. He focused on teaching the fundamental principles of Motivational Interviewing and managing resistance. He also takes pride in raising staff awareness about their direct impact on the successes and failures of the families they serve. 
               </p>
               <p>In his current role, Oliver oversees various responsibilities, including DCF Licensing, Department of Public Health compliance, facility management, hiring, and payroll, all while fostering strong bonds with the operational staff.</p>
               <p><b>Oliver's words:</b><br>
                  <em>"What I appreciate most about BGV is its commitment to addressing the diverse needs of the populations we serve. There's no one-size-fits-all approach here;
                  instead, employees are encouraged to think creatively and adapt to achieve greater success..."</em>
               </p>
               <p>The most valuable aspect for me is the trusting professional relationships I've cultivated with the staff. Despite my position, I've created an environment where staff feel comfortable expressing their questions,
                  thoughts, concerns, and ideas. We operate under the ethos of 'Ten Toes In', signifying our full commitment to consistency in protocols and prioritizing the well-being of the children we serve."

               <p>As an adoptee, a victim of child abuse, a survivor, and a resident of Connecticut, when I learned about BGV's mission to create a positive future for Connecticut's
                  most at-risk children and families, I knew I had to explore the organization's services and clients and see if my experience, background, and time might be able to have a meaningful impact. After spending a day with some of the children attending Charles F.
                  Hayden School, hearing their stories, and reflecting on my own past,  I was moved to act. I was grateful to be invited to join the Board to begin my journey of service.

               <p>BGV embraces the unique challenges associated with the care, support, and development of the most precious resource we have in Connecticut â€” our children. 
                  I am consistently amazed at the broad range of services BGV provides combined with the compassion and commitment all staff demonstrate day in and day out.
                  The BGV team's understanding of how to appeal to the hearts and minds of the children and families they serve is extraordinary.
               </p>

               <p>Treatment of mental health issues in our society is a complex matter. BGV's hands-on, expertly-trained, intensive assistance and care methods demonstrate time and again that with commitment a well-run organization can make a lasting difference and drive positive outcomes in the lives of children and their families.
                  All children â€” under all circumstances â€” deserve to feel safe, cared for, and supported. My dream for BGV is for the organization to have the resources â€” both human and financial â€” to insure that any child who is the unfortunate victim of abuse,
                  or battling mental health issues, has the unwavering opportunity to establish a solid emotional and intellectual foundation to thrive in this world.
